#### Description

> One of the most fundamental characteristics of human nature is a soul’s desire to explore reality and search for meaning in the universe – the mind longs to understand.  Language is the medium by which we can think about and describe our understandings of reality.

Did you ever try to use an online translator...but it would just translate your sentence into a messy, conglomeration of jumbled words? translateYo attempts to tackle this problem by creating a user-friendly space in our application for users to ask other, real users around the world for a close to perfect, if not perfect, translation.

In addition to users being able to receive better translations of sentences and paragraphs, users are able to see how high they can reach the sky with the star points they receive from the users that thought that their translation was stellar!
